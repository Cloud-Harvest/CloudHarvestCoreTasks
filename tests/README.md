# Test Notes
To fully test the suite, the following must be in place:

* A local MongoDB instance
* A local Redis instance
* A running copy of the CloudHarvest API

Tests are written using the `unittest` framework and can be run using the command. When using IDEs like PyCharm, make
sure the test configuration is set to `unittest` and not `pytest`.
